picoCTF 2025 — Cookie Monster Secret Receipe (Web Exploitation) 
Challenge Description
Cookie Monster has hidden his top-secret cookie recipe somewhere on his website. As an aspiring cookie detective, your mission is to uncover this delectable secret. Can you outsmart Cookie Monster and find the hidden recipe?
Challenge website: http://verbal-sleep.picoctf.net:56241/

Approach & Solution
1. Initial Reconnaissance
Visited the challenge website.

Observed a login form with “user” and “password” input fields, but no other visible links or hints.

2. Testing Login Form
Tried submitting various credentials (common, random, and default pairs).

Every attempt resulted in an error message:

Access Denied
Cookie Monster says: "Me no need password. Me just need cookies!"
Hint: Have you checked your cookies lately?

Key insight: The hint clearly suggests that the solution involves browser cookies—not the credential fields.

3. Inspecting Cookies
Opened the browser’s Developer Tools (Application/Storage tab) and checked under “Cookies” for the challenge domain.

Detected a cookie named secret recipe with a suspicious, base64-looking value:

text
cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzXzZDMkZCN0YzfQ==
Noted that its character set, length (multiple of 4), and == padding strongly suggested base64 encoding.

4. Decoding the Secret
Decoded the cookie value using base64 tools (online, terminal, or browser console).

Output:

text
picoCTF{c00k1e_m0nster_l0ves_c00kies_6C2FB7F3}
This matched the standard CTF flag pattern, confirming it as the solution.

Exploit Summary Table
Step	What To Do	Why?
1	Try login, read error/hint	See what the app is protecting or hinting
2	Inspect cookies in dev tools	Find hidden values associated with session
3	Decode suspicious base64 cookie value	Secret/flag often encoded, not encrypted
4	Submit decoded value as flag	Complete the challenge
Lessons Learned
Don’t trust the UI: Even if there is a login page, the secret might be hidden elsewhere (e.g., in browser cookies).

Cookieless authentication or clues: CTFs often hide flags in cookies, localStorage, or HTML comments rather than traditional protected pages.

Base64 patterns: Knowing the signs and how to quickly decode base64 strings is a vital web CTF skill.
