picoCTF 2025 — head-dump
Overview
This repository documents my solution for the picoCTF News web exploitation challenge. The challenge required exploring a blog-style web application, discovering misconfigured API endpoints, and ultimately retrieving a hidden flag from the server’s memory through a diagnostic heap dump.

Challenge Description
The web application is a simple blog with the following features:

Multiple articles with clickable hashtags but non-clickable article titles.

Navigation to an API Documentation section powered by Swagger UI, which listed all available backend endpoints.

A vulnerable diagnostic endpoint found under "Diagnosing":

text
/heapdump
This endpoint generates and offers a downloadable heap memory snapshot (heapsnapshot file), potentially leaking sensitive information.

Goal:
Analyze the app, find a mechanism to download and analyze server memory, and extract the secret flag.

Steps to Exploit
1. Initial Reconnaissance
Visited the site and noticed only hashtags were interactive.

Clicking the hashtag [#API Documentation] led to Swagger UI.

2. API Discovery via Swagger
Explored the API endpoints presented in Swagger UI.

Spotted the "Diagnosing" section with a /heapdump endpoint — a strong indicator of exposed server memory functionality.

3. Triggering the Vulnerable Endpoint
Used Swagger UI's "Try it out" feature on /heapdump.

The endpoint returned a downloadable heap snapshot file:

text
heapdump-<timestamp>.heapsnapshot
4. Extracting the Flag
Downloaded the .heapsnapshot file (about 9MB).

Opened the file in a text editor and searched for the flag format using the keyword picoCTF{.

Alternatively, used command-line tools for efficiency:

text
grep -a picoCTF heapdump-*.heapsnapshot
Located the picoCTF{...} flag embedded in the heap data.

Key Vulnerability
The core issue was the exposure of a heap memory dump endpoint in a production environment. Diagnostic endpoints like /heapdump can leak application memory, including in-memory secrets such as flags, credentials, or keys, if accessed by unauthorized users.

Exploit Summary Table
Step	What to Do	Why?
1	Enter API Documentation via clickable hashtag	Find hidden/test endpoints
2	Use Swagger UI to locate /heapdump under Diagnosing	Diagnostic endpoints often leak sensitive memory
3	Execute /heapdump and download the file	Retrieve server memory snapshot
4	Search the file for picoCTF{ using editor/CLI tools	Extract the hidden flag
Lessons Learned
Never leave diagnostic endpoints publicly accessible. Heap snapshots can contain a wealth of sensitive information.

API documentation (Swagger UI) can expose hidden functionality to unauthenticated users.

Sensitive memory files should be tightly access-controlled and never exposed in test or production environments.

Efficient searching: Always use pattern-based searches (picoCTF{, etc.) for large files during CTFs.
